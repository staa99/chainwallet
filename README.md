A basic on-chain second-layer wallet system. Wallets are managed by a master contract that enables the use 
of a single EOA to control multiple wallets, effectively creating a gateway for securely accessing cryptocurrencies
and interacting with smart contracts. It also enables an additional layer of privacy that makes it harder
to trace transactions directly to the EOA.


## Features

- Create managed accounts
- Share wallets between EOAs
- Interact with smart contracts from managed accounts
- Send and Receive Ether from managed accounts
